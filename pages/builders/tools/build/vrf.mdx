# VRF: Verifiable Random Function

This reference guide serves as a comprehensive resource for leveraging VRF solutions when building on Optimism.

## What is VRF?

VRF, or Verifiable Random Function, introduces a new dimension of trust and randomness to smart contract applications. With VRF, developers can securely generate random values on-chain, providing a crucial building block for various use cases such as gaming, lotteries, and cryptographic protocols.
By integrating VRF solutions into your applications, you can ensure fairness and transparency, as the generated randomness is verifiable by all parties involved. This enhances the integrity of decentralized systems and fosters trust among users.

## Gelato

[Gelato](https://www.gelato.network/) VRF enables smart contracts on Optimism to access verifiable randomness. Gelato VRF offers real randomness for blockchain applications by leveraging Drand, a trusted decentralized source for random numbers.

By leveraging Gelato's infrastructure, developers can securely generate random values transparently, enhancing applications like gaming, DeFi, and much more!

### How does Gelato VRF work?

Gelato VRF (Verifiable Random Function) provides trustable randomness on EVM-compatible blockchains. Here's a brief overview:

- Contract Deployment: Use GelatoVRFConsumerBase.sol as an interface for requesting random numbers.
- Requesting Randomness: Emit the RequestedRandomness event to signal the need for a random number.
- Processing: Gelato VRF fetches the random number from Drand.
- Delivery: The fulfillRandomness function delivers the random number to the requesting contract.
